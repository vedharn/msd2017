The first problem explores various modeling scenarios, the second looks at cross-validation for polynomial regression, and the third involves fitting and interpreting a model of supermarket sales data.
Details are in the README.md file for each problem.

Your code and a brief report with your results are to be submitted electronically in one zipped (or tarball-ed) file through the [CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/sis_course_id:APMAE4990_001_2017_1) site.
All code should be contained in plain text files and should produce the exact results you provide in your writeup.
Code should be written in bash / R and should not have complex dependencies on non-standard libraries.
The report should simply present your answers to the questions in an organized format as either a plain text or pdf file.
All work should be your own and done individually.

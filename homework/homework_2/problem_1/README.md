### 1. Modeling scenarios

For each of parts a) through d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

  a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.

  b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.

  c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.

  d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. Var(Îµ), is extremely high.

Note: This problem was taken from Section 2.4 of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).

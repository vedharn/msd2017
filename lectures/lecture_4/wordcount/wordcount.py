# description: the obligatory wordcount example for an introduction to
# mapreduce, implemented in hadoop streaming using a simple wrapper
# class (hstream). counts the number of times each word in the input
# occurs.
#
# usage:
#   locally:
#     map only: cat input.txt | ./wordcount.py -m
#     map+"shuffle": cat input.txt | ./wordcount.py -m | sort -k1
#     map+"shuffle"+reduce: cat input.txt | ./wordcount.py -r
#       which is equivalent to:
#       cat input.txt | ./wordcount.py -m | sort -k1 | ./wordcount.py -r
#   distributed:
#     (assumes $HADOOP_HOME is set to your hadoop install)
#
#     $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar $HADOOP_HOME/contrib/streaming/hadoop-*-streaming.jar \
#       -input input.txt \
#       -output wc_output \
#       -mapper 'wordcount.py -m' \
#       -reducer 'wordcount.py -r' \
#       -file wordcount.py \
#       -file hstream.py
